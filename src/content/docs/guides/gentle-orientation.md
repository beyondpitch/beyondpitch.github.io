**Begin your voice journey with clarity, care, and intention.**



## 🌿 What to Expect

This wiki is designed to help you build a voice that feels:

* **Safe and aligned** with your sense of self
* **Sustainable** over time (no pain, no tension)
* **Adaptable** — whether you’re seeking feminization, healing, or simply self-connection

This process is not about “performing” a voice — it’s about *uncovering the voice that was always yours*, even if it’s been hidden under habits, tension, fear, or dysphoria.

> ⚠️ **Important:** This is not about chasing a perfect “feminine” sound right away. That pressure can cause tension and delay progress. Feminization (if desired) is a separate, later path that builds *after* your natural voice is stable and pain-free.

## 🔄 How to Begin Each Day

Before you dive into any exercises:

### 1. **Check in with your body**

* Are your **jaw and shoulders** relaxed?
* Is your **breath shallow or held**?
* Are you carrying **any fear, rush, or performance anxiety**?

> 🧘 Try a 30-second body scan. Just noticing tension softens it.

### 2. **Find Your Pitch Home (Step 0)**

* Every day, your voice may land in a slightly different place — that’s normal.
* Don’t *force* yourself to speak at a pitch from yesterday. Your body leads, not a goal.

### 3. **Set an Intention**

Examples:

* “I want to stay curious and gentle today.”
* “I’ll notice my breath more than my pitch.”
* “Even if it’s just 5 minutes, I’ll stay present.”

## 🫧 How to Warm Up (Gently)

Before starting Steps 1–3, take 3–5 minutes to:

* **Do a few straw bubbles** in water to connect to your breath
* **Hum softly** to feel your lips, cheeks, and nose buzz (not your throat!)
* **Do some sirens** up and down — ghostly “ooooh” sounds — to wake up range and vibration

> 🌼 If you’re tired, sick, dysphoric, or dysregulated, it’s okay to *just do the warmup and rest*. That still counts. That’s still training.

## 🧭 How to Move Through the Steps

* Each **step builds on the last**. Don’t skip ahead — your voice will thank you.
* You don’t need to “master” a step before moving forward — just feel mostly stable and tension-free.
* You can *always come back* to earlier steps to reset.

Think of this like building a house:

* You’re not decorating the roof before the foundation.
* Pitch, breath, and buzz are your bricks and mortar.

## 💌 What If You Feel Lost?

Voice work brings up **old habits, emotions, and self-judgment.** That’s okay.

* Your voice might sound “weird” at first. That’s okay.
* You might feel nothing is happening. That’s okay too.
* Sometimes “bad days” are actually your voice adjusting and healing.

> 🙏 *Kindness to yourself is more powerful than a perfect pitch.*

## 🌟 Suggested First Practice (Day 1)

**Try this simple flow to begin your journey:**

1. Blow bubbles into a cup of water for 30 seconds
2. Do 3 sirens (“oooooh”) up and down, lightly
3. Hum “Mmm…” at a comfy pitch — not too low, not too high
4. Say “Mmm… mine” or “Mmm… maybe” a few times
5. Reflect: *Where did I feel the buzz? Was my throat relaxed? Did I enjoy any part of that?*

That’s it. You’ve started.
