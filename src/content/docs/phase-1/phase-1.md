title: Phase 1 TL;DR — Foundations
description: This phase builds the core mechanics of your voice.
---

This phase builds the core *mechanics* of your voice: breath, buzz, and basic speech. The goal is ease, not performance. You're learning how your voice *feels* when it's free and connected.

---

### 🔹 **Step 0: Pitch Home**

Find your natural, comfortable pitch each day — the one that feels effortless and buzzy. This is your vocal “home base.”

---

### 🔹 **Step 1: Airflow & Reset**

Use breath-based warmups (like straw bubbling or lip trills) to reset tension and reconnect with relaxed, supported airflow.

---

### 🔹 **Step 2: Forward Resonance**

Shift the vibration of your voice out of your throat and into your lips, nose, and cheeks. This makes your voice sound brighter, lighter, and more resonant.

---

### 🔹 **Step 3: M-Word Practice**

Bridge from hums into simple words (“Mmm… morning”). Keep buzz, breath, and pitch steady as you move toward real speech.

---

> 💡 The magic in Phase 1 is subtle: you're creating a voice that flows from *feeling*, not forcing. Everything that comes next builds on this foundation.
