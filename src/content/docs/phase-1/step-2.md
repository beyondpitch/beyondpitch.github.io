title:  Step 2 - Off the Straw Humming
description: To begin using your natural voice without the straw whiel maintaining steady breath, light resonance, and no throat tension.
---

## 🎯 Goal

To begin using your **natural voice without the straw** while maintaining:

* A steady, supported breath
* Freedom from throat tension
* A light, **forward resonance** (vibrations felt in the **lips, cheeks, and nose**)

> 💡 **What is resonance?**
> Resonance is where your voice “vibrates” or feels most alive in your body. Forward resonance — in your facial mask (lips, cheeks, nose) — helps your voice feel lighter, clearer, and less effortful.

## 🪞 Step-by-Step Instructions

### ✅ 1. **Begin with Breath Awareness**

Before using your voice:

1. Place one hand on your **belly**, the other on your **chest**.
2. Inhale gently through your **nose**. Let your **belly rise** while your chest stays quiet.
3. Exhale slowly through pursed lips or a silent “shhh.” Let your belly soften inward.

🔁 Do 2–3 of these **warm-up breaths** to connect with **diaphragmatic breathing** and release tension.

---

### ✅ 2. **Hum Softly: “Mmm…”**

1. Keep your **mouth closed** and **lips relaxed**.
2. Inhale gently through your nose.
3. Exhale on a **soft, effortless “Mmm…”** — like you're tasting something delicious:
   *“Mmm, this is so good…”*
4. Let your **lips buzz gently**, as if the sound floats forward on the breath.

🎯 The hum should feel **easy, not pushed**. If it feels tight, lighten the volume or go back to silent breath.

---

### ✅ 3. **Add a Gentle Siren (Pitch Glide)**

1. On your next hum, slowly **slide your pitch up and down** like a siren:

   * Start around your **mid-range (e.g., G3 or 196 Hz)**
   * Rise gently, then fall back down
2. Keep the motion **smooth**, like a soft wave 🌊 — no leaps or jolts

> 💡 Visualize the sound as **riding on a ribbon of air**, not being pushed out. The goal is control through **ease**.

🎯 Focus on:

* Steady airflow — no breath holding or gasping
* Gentle buzz in the **lips, nose, or cheeks**
* Jaw and throat remain soft and still

🔁 Try 2–3 glides, each lasting 3–5 seconds. Rest if needed.

---

### 🔍 4. **Self Check-In: What Do You Notice?**

After each glide, gently ask:

* Are my **shoulders relaxed** and not lifting?
* Do I feel **vibrations in my lips or cheeks**?
* Is my **jaw loose** and tongue resting?
* Is my **throat quiet**, not grabbing or squeezing?
* Am I **exhaling the whole time**, or holding air?

📍 If tension creeps in, return to a **mid-pitch steady hum** before trying glides again.

---

## 🌈 When It’s Feeling Easy…

Explore **different siren shapes** to build flexibility:

* Glide **up and down 3–5 notes**
* Glide **down from mid to low**, then back
* Try **gentle pitch wiggles** without breaking the airflow

🎯 Always prioritize **ease over range**. Gentle variation trains control and adaptability.

---

## ✅ Signs of Success

You’re on the right track when:

* The **hum feels light and supported**
* Your **lips buzz** gently without pressure
* Airflow is **steady and connected to your body**
* Your **throat stays relaxed**, even at the top or bottom of the glide
* You feel a sense of **calm, presence, and resonance**

---

## 🚦 Listen to Your Body

If you experience:

* Throat tightness
* Strain or breathlessness
* Lightheadedness

👉 **Pause. Rest. Reconnect with breath.**
Never force your voice. It will grow through softness and repetition, not effort or volume.

---

## 💖 Gentle Reminders

* Voice growth takes time. **Celebrate the small wins**: a relaxed hum, a buzz in the lips, a smooth breath.
* Stay **hydrated** before and after — water supports vocal fold flexibility.
* If you're feeling stuck, it's okay to revisit **Step 1** or consult a voice coach.

## 🎯 Next Step

Once this humming feels natural and consistent, you're ready for **Step 3: “Mmm” Word Practice**, where you’ll gently begin attaching this healthy hum to real speech.
