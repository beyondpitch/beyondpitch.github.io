## 🧭 The Goal Right Now

Your goal isn’t to “sound feminine” or “hit a high note.”
It’s to **find the pitch that feels most sustainable, resonant, and free** in your body *today*.

We’ll call this your **“Pitch Home”** — the place your voice **wants to live** when it's supported by breath and free from tension.

A healthy “Pitch Home” will:

* Flow effortlessly on an exhale
* Avoid tightness or pressure in the throat
* Allow for some **forward buzz** (that subtle vibration in your lips, cheeks, or nose)
* Feel like a note you could *stay on for a while* without discomfort

👉 This pitch becomes your **baseline “True Voice”** — not because it's fixed forever, but because it's grounded in **authenticity, health, and connection**.
We’ll build femininity from **resonance**, **airflow**, and **expression** — *not just pitch*.

## tl;dr;

The goal is to identify your **"Pitch Home,"** the most comfortable and resonant pitch for your voice today, which should feel effortless and free from tension. 

**Key Points:**
- Your Pitch Home should allow for smooth airflow, avoid throat tightness, and create a gentle buzz in your lips, cheeks, or nose.
- Before starting, check that your throat is relaxed, you're not in pain, and you're hydrated.
- An optional warm-up includes deep breaths, blowing bubbles through a straw, and gentle sirens.
- Use the **“Sigh Down” Test**: Relax, inhale, and exhale a gentle sigh while gliding down in pitch until you find a comfortable note. Hold it and check for relaxation and buzz.
- Optionally, use a pitch app to track your pitch over time, aiming for a range around **E3–F3 (160–175 Hz)** for healthy voice work.
- Expect your Pitch Home to shift daily based on breath support and emotional state.
- Daily practice should start with 3–5 “Sigh Downs” to find your Pitch Home, followed by light humming and pitch glides.

Focus on ease and connection to your voice rather than perfection. The most important measure of progress is how your voice feels.

## 🩺 Before You Begin: A Quick Self Check-In

To protect your voice, take a moment to assess:

✅ Does your throat feel relaxed and pain-free?
✅ Are you recovering from a cold, allergies, or voice strain?
✅ Are you hydrated and emotionally grounded enough to check in with your body?

📌 If you’re hoarse, in pain, or feeling triggered or overwhelmed, skip today or keep it extra gentle. Voice work is **body work**, and your safety comes first.

## 🌬️ Optional Vocal Warm-Up (Recommended)

Gently prepare your voice with a quick 1–2 minute warm-up:

* Take 3–4 deep breaths with your hand on your belly
* Blow soft bubbles into water with a straw on a steady exhale
* Do one gentle siren (slide up and down) on “oooh” or “mmm…”

## 🎯 How to Find Your Comfortable Pitch (No Tools Required)

### 🌀 **The “Sigh Down” Test**

This is a quick daily scan to locate your most free, resonant pitch.

1. **Relax** your shoulders and jaw. Breathe in slowly through your nose.
2. As you exhale, sigh gently on **“Mmm…”** or **“Ahhh…”** — not dramatic, just easy.
3. Let your voice **glide down** in pitch like you're letting air out of a balloon.
4. Pause when it feels **natural to stay**:

   * Not too low or rumbly in your chest
   * Not overly high or nasal
   * Ideally where your **breath flows easily**, and your **voice vibrates gently in the face**
5. Try holding this pitch for 2–3 seconds:

   * Is your throat relaxed?
   * Can you feel some **buzz in the lips, nose, or cheeks**?
   * Could you speak here comfortably for a while?

📌 **That’s your Pitch Home for today.**

🧘‍♀️ This is not a “target” — it’s a reflection of how your body feels right now. Trust it. Your Pitch Home may shift a little each day.

## 📱 Optional: Use a Pitch App for Feedback

If you’re curious or want data to track over time:

* Try apps like **Vocal Pitch Monitor** (Android) or **SingScope** (iOS)
* Do the “Sigh Down” 3–4 times and see where your pitch lands
* You may notice a pattern over time — many trans women find **E3–F3 (160–175 Hz)** to be a balanced, healthy foundation for voice work

💡 This range supports both resonance training and pitch flexibility, and it often *naturally rises* over time with consistent breath and forward focus.

---

## 🧠 What to Expect Over Time

With gentle daily practice, your Pitch Home might:

* Rise slightly as you build breath and resonance
* Feel more “buzzy” and easy as throat tension reduces
* Shift with your emotional state — sadness might lower it, excitement might raise it

💡 That’s normal. This isn’t about forcing pitch *up* — it’s about letting your voice **lift itself** when it’s supported, safe, and ready.

## ✅ Today’s Practice Plan

🔁 Start here each day before you work on other voice exercises.

1. Do 3–5 “Sigh Downs” to gently find your Pitch Home
2. Then use that pitch as your **base for:**

   * Light humming
   * Gentle sirens (pitch glides)
   * M-word transitions (like “Mmm… maybe” or “Mmm… my mood”)

🧭 Don’t worry about being “right.” Just aim for ease, freedom, and a sense of **pleasant connection** to your voice.

> 💖 The most important measure of progress is how your voice *feels* — not how it sounds.
