**Trans voice PSA for the girlies** 💕 (and theydies, and everyone else trying to feminize their voice)

One of the most common questions I see from trans women and transfemmes is:

**“How do I sound more feminine?”**
or
**“Why won’t my voice pass?”**

Let’s break it down.

### ❌ First, what **won’t** change it:

**HRT doesn’t feminize your voice.**
You can take estrogen and spironolactone for a decade, and your voice will stay the same — unless you train it.

That’s because your voice is a **muscular habit**, not something governed by hormones.

### ✅ What **does** make a feminine voice?

Most beginners focus on **pitch**, but that’s actually the **least important** gender cue.
Here’s a simplified breakdown of what matters most (approximate impact on gender perception):

* **Pitch** (how high or low your voice sounds): \~5%
* **Intonation** (melody, rise/fall, expression): \~15%
* **Weight** (how heavy/pressed your vocal folds are): \~15%
* **Resonance** (where your voice vibrates and how it resonates): \~65%

Resonance is the *main* thing that makes you sound feminine, neutral, or masculine.
**It’s not pitch.**

---

### 🗣️ Let's define the four elements:

**🎼 Pitch:**

* Frequency of your vocal cords' vibration (measured in Hz).
* Cis women often speak between 165–255 Hz; cis men, 85–155 Hz.
* You don’t need to be super high-pitched — a lot of passing voices are only \~160–180 Hz.

**🎤 Intonation:**

* The *melody* of your speech.
* Masculine voices tend to be flatter and more monotone; feminine voices often rise at the end of phrases and vary more expressively.

**🪨 Weight (a.k.a. vocal effort/compression):**

* This is how tight, gravelly, or pressed your vocal folds are.
* “Heavy” voices feel dense or gritty; “light” voices feel breezy or relaxed.
* Feminine voices tend to be lighter and smoother.

**🔊 Resonance:**

* Where your voice **sounds like it’s coming from** — chest, mouth, nose, or head.
* Masculine voices tend to have chesty, dark, or boomy resonance.
* Feminine voices often feel brighter, forward, and “buzzier” — resonating more in the **mask** of the face (nose, lips, upper cheeks).

⚠️ Note: This isn't about *nasality*. Forward resonance is different from a “nasal” voice.

---

### 🎯 Your goal in training should be:

* **Lift your resonance** into a more forward, brighter placement.
* **Lighten your weight** by reducing vocal fold compression.
* **Add melodic intonation** — speak more musically!
* Then **adjust pitch** just enough to support the illusion — not too low or too high.

You don’t need to sound like a Disney princess to pass.
You just need **congruence** between the elements, and a voice that feels natural and consistent.

### ⚒️ Training tips:

* **Start with resonance and weight.** These matter more than pitch and are harder to fake.
* **Pitch glides and humming** are great daily warmups.
* Try **talking while smiling** — this helps shift your resonance forward and up.
* **Don't force it.** If it hurts or strains, stop. A healthy feminine voice feels easy.
* **Record yourself.** It’s painful at first, but it’s the best way to measure real progress.
* Practice **every day**, even just 5–10 minutes. Think muscle memory.

---

### 🎧 Ear training matters more than you think:

You can’t imitate what you can’t hear.

* Listen closely to women’s voices (news anchors, streamers, YouTubers).
* Imitate not just pitch but melody, softness, and rhythm.
* Use spectrograms or visualizers if you're a visual learner.

### 🧠 A note on range:

Your **anatomical pitch limits** can’t change much — that’s determined by vocal fold length and larynx size.
But your **habitual speaking range** can **absolutely** be retrained. With time, you can learn to comfortably speak higher than your old baseline.

---

### 🏥 Surgery? Not required.

Voice surgery can raise pitch but often sacrifices range and may not affect resonance.
You can develop a beautiful, passable voice without it — it just takes practice and time.

---

### 💖 You got this.

Every trans woman I know who practiced consistently now has a voice that *passes*.
You are not broken. Your voice isn’t wrong.
You just haven’t taught it a new song yet.

Keep going. 🎶✨
