A grounding check-in to return to your voice — anytime, anywhere.

These are not rules. They’re gentle questions to *feel your way back home*.

---

## 🌬️ Breath

✅ Did I breathe in through my nose?  
✅ Did my belly expand?  
✅ Am I riding the exhale or pushing from my throat?

---

## 🌟 Buzz

✅ Do I feel vibration in my **lips, cheeks, or nose**?  
✅ Is my voice *riding* the breath or trying to *lead* it?  
✅ Can I speak softer and still feel present?

---

## 🧘‍♀️ Ease

✅ Is my jaw loose?  
✅ Are my shoulders soft?  
✅ Am I rushing, or is this allowed to take its time?

---

## 💬 Expression

✅ Am I *connecting* or *performing*?  
✅ Does this feel like *me* — just clearer, easier, more embodied?  
✅ Am I okay letting this be simple today?
