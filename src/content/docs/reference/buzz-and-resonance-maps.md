> How to feel, shift, and track where your voice vibrates

Buzz — or **resonance** — is how your voice vibrates through your body. Where you *feel* that vibration matters: it’s the key to discovering your **true voice** and supporting **sustainable speaking**.

This page helps you **understand what buzz is**, **map where it lands**, **shift it forward**, and **track your progress over time**.

## 🐣 What Is Buzz? (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine your voice is a **bee** flying around your face when you talk.

The **buzz** is where the bee lands — where you feel a tiny vibration in your body when you hum or speak. That’s called **resonance**.

When the bee lands:
- 🛑 In your throat → it feels tight, tired, heavy  
- 🟡 On your lips, cheeks, or nose → it feels light, clear, easy

Your goal is to help the bee land in **the front of your face**, not your throat.

## 🎧 What Is Forward Resonance?

Forward resonance means:
- You feel sound vibration in your **lips**, **nose**, or **cheeks**
- You *don’t* feel it stuck in your **throat** or **deep in your neck**

You’re not “pushing” your voice forward — you’re gently inviting it forward by:
- Staying in your **Pitch Home**
- Breathing out as you speak
- Using soft sounds like “Mmm” or “Nnn”
- Relaxing your throat and smiling softly

## 🧪 How to Feel Buzz

### ✅ Step-by-Step

1. **Start with Pitch Home**  
   Find your daily natural comfortable pitch (e.g. F3/E3 range)

2. **Light Hum**  
   Say “Mmmmmm” gently on your Pitch Home  
   (not loud, not tight, just steady)

3. **Touch Test**  
   Lightly place fingers on:
   - Lips
   - Cheeks
   - Nose
   - Jaw
   - Throat

4. **Feel for vibration**
   Wherever you feel little tingles, that’s the buzz!

## 🧭 Exercises to Shift Buzz Forward

### 🎯 1. Lip & Cheek Focus
- Lightly touch cheeks/lips
- Hum “Mmm” or “Nnn” until buzz shows up in fingers
- Smile softly as you hum to help lift buzz

### 🌈 2. “M Words” on the Buzz
- Pick some M words (e.g. “me,” “mine,” “Monday”)
- Start each with a buzz: “Mmmmme,” “Mmmmine”
- Only say the word if the **buzz is forward**

### 🎢 3. Siren Search
- Do a siren (pitch glide up and down) on “ng” or “mmm”
- Move slowly — find pitch where buzz floats forward
- Mark that pitch as part of your “Resonant Range”

## 💡 Bonus Reset: Straw Bubbling
If buzz feels stuck in the throat:
- Bubble in a straw + cup for 1–2 minutes
- Relax the voice box and airflow
- Try your hum again — buzz will likely move forward more easily

---

## 🔄 It’s Okay If…

- The buzz moves around day to day  
- You can’t feel it clearly right away  
- It drops to your throat on words  

This is part of the learning process. Every repetition builds connection.
