<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Phase 1 - Foundations" icon="step-by-step-guide">
		This phase builds the core mechanics of your voice: breath, buzz, and basic speech. The goal is ease, not performance. You're learning how your voice feels when it's free and connected.

		<LinkButton href="/phase-1/phase-1/">Phase 1</LinkButton>
	</Card>
	<Card title="Phase 2 - Real-Life Voice" icon="add-document">
		This phase brings your voice into flowing speech. You’ll smooth transitions, add expressiveness, and start using your voice more naturally in everyday life. It’s all about connection, clarity, and confidence.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Phase 3 - Feminization" icon="setting">
		This phase focuses on shaping your voice with the qualities often associated with feminine communication. It's expressive, nuanced, and intentional — but always grounded in your voice, not someone else’s idea of it.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Vocal Mixing Board" icon="setting">
		Voice isn’t a single thing — it’s a **blend of elements** you can shape over time. Think of it like a **mixing board**: instead of one big “feminine voice” switch, you’re adjusting individual sliders like **pitch**, **resonance**, **flow**, and **melody** to build a voice that feels expressive, healthy, and *you*.
